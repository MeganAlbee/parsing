## Assignment: Parsing

This repo has two notebooks in it. The first, `spaCy Tutorial`, is an introduction to 
spaCy by [Damir Cavar](http://damir.cavar.me/). 
The original notebook can be found [here](https://github.com/dcavar/python-tutorial-notebooks/blob/master/notebooks/spaCy%20Tutorial.ipynb). This notebook walks you through
many of the features of spaCy, a
tremendously powerful NLP package that 
we'll start using in the latter bit of the course.

The second, `Parsing Introduction`, introduces you to parsing with `spaCy`.  
This notebook introduces you (very briefly) to spaCy. I also recommend watching
the [introductory video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnGPv6HnBok) to learn more. 
This notebook will get you started extracting Subject-Verb-Object entities from 
a piece of text. 

### Assignment

In a notebook that you create, extract the SVOs from the Republican and Democratic 
National Conventions. 

Report the top 25 SVOs from each convention and write a few
sentences about what, if anything, you think we can glean from these lists. 

### Takeaways

In the Republican text, we do not see "elect" as a verb. While Republicans have the subject "they" and Democrats do not. 

I strongly believe insights about political styles could be gleaned with more information and text. For example, Trump's political platform was composed of many topics, but I think it strongly resonated with the Populism movement, Cesar Chavez (Venezuela), and Latin American (1980s~) politicians. Additionally, there are public relations tactics that would be exciting insights if more scripts were taken. 

To note, I hold a minor in global politics from Cal Poly SLO and with that comes politicians and campaigning. Additionally, I worked in public relations in California for the City of San Luis Obispo's Mayor Heidi Harmon, the Sheriff's Office SLO, and tourism. I may not be a linguistic but I do know words matter. 


Lastly, I see "javascript" "enable," and I believe my corpus could be cleaner.
